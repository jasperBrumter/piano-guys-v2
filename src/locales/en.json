		"quote": "Rebuilding pianos is not just a job, It’s a calling; a time honored craft performed by artisans who really know and care about pianos. A piano is not just a piece of furniture, but rather an instrument capable of reacting to a player’s emotions, technique and creativity. Three pianos of the same make, size and close in years can sound as different as night and day. They can be dark and mysterious or rich and singing.",
